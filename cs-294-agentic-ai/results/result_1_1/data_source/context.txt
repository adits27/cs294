Randomized Controlled Trial: Impact of Online Tutoring on Student Test Scores

RESEARCH QUESTION:
Does providing access to an online tutoring platform improve student test scores compared to standard instruction alone?

STUDY DESIGN:
This is a randomized controlled trial conducted over one academic semester with high school students.

SAMPLE:
- Total participants: 200 students
- Randomization: Students were randomly assigned to treatment or control group using computer-generated random numbers
- Treatment group (n=100): Received access to online tutoring platform
- Control group (n=100): Continued with standard instruction only

TREATMENT DESCRIPTION:
Treatment group students received login credentials for an adaptive online tutoring platform that provided:
- Personalized math and reading exercises
- Immediate feedback on practice problems
- Video explanations of key concepts
- Weekly progress reports
Students were encouraged but not required to use the platform at least 3 times per week.

OUTCOME MEASURE:
The primary outcome is the end-of-semester standardized test score (scale: 0-100), administered to all students under controlled testing conditions.

DATA COLLECTION:
- Baseline characteristics collected: age, prior GPA, gender
- Treatment assignment recorded
- End-of-semester test scores recorded for all participants
- No missing data for primary outcome

STUDY AIM:
To estimate the average treatment effect of online tutoring access on test scores and determine whether the intervention is effective enough to warrant broader implementation.

HYPOTHESIS:
We hypothesize that students with access to online tutoring will score higher on average than control students (H0: ATE = 0, HA: ATE > 0).

ANALYSIS PLAN:
- Calculate average treatment effect
- Test for statistical significance using two-sample t-test
- Check for balance on baseline covariates
- Perform regression analysis adjusting for covariates
